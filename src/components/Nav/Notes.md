#      <center>Nav-Terminal</center>
--------------------------------
React Router</br>props?</br>state?</br>useRoute?</br>useLocation?</br>useRef?


is react even the right framework?</br>
<i>nextjs is specifally for multipage, the router in react it's self seems to the issue.<i />

# Logic
------------
pages are and array []

page itself is a class


each page is a function


i need to have react-hackterm
use the array to
define the class of page.
then
have the terminal
